<h2><a href="current project" style="color: #f7c31f;">Current Project (Last Updated: 02/09/2025)</a></h2>

Here's what I've been working on the last few months, it's my FPS template project. I wanted to create a base first person controller project so that I could use it for anything I want in the future.
I love games like Penumbra, Amnesia, Soma, and this controller was heavily inspired by the controller in those games.

<h2><a href="current project" style="color: #f7c31f;">Mech Jam Project 2025 (Last Updated: 02/09/2025)</a></h2>
It started as a game jam project but quickly evolved into something I'm going to continue working on! 
The FPS template project helped me a ton for this and I'm glad that I could finally put it to use.
