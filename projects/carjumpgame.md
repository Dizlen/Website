### Unreleased Car Jump Game
This prototype was a simple game about racing other players by jumping from car to car to reach the end of the level. It took inspiration from another mobile game Aqua Park. I started by learning how to use the plugin Dreamteck Splines. I made some models in Blender and was able to hook them up with the splines.

For fun, I added some grind rails that the player could jump on and use to traverse the level.

After some more work and some funny AI, here is the end prototype. Unfortunately the results weren't what we expected, so we had to scrap the game.
