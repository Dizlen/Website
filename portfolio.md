## <a href="voodoo" style="color: #f7c31f;">Voodoo (2022–Ongoing)</a>  

At Voodoo, I work as a Marketing Developer which is a relatively new role in the games industry. My job is to take finished Unity games and transform them into short, engaging advertisements, often by prototyping new features or gameplay scenarios specifically for creative testing.

To date, I’ve worked on over 1,000 ads. Not all of them are hits, but each one brings a new creative challenge — which is what I love most about the role. I often describe it to friends as “like working on a game jam every day”.

I primarily use Unity, After Effects, and Blender, and I typically have 1–2 working days to complete each ad from concept to final render.
