### Morph Race
This prototype was made during a trend of morphing games. The concept is very simple, change the shape of the player character to get past obstacles and reach the end of the level. At first I tried to use simple abstract shapes, but the final version was changed to morph between a boat, car and a truck. I acomplished the "morphing" by creating the models in blender and creating blend shapes between them.
