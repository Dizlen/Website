<h2 style="color: #f7c31f;">Untitled Tower Defense Game - March 2025</h2>

I worked with a client that wanted me to create them a top down tower defense game.
We agreed that there would be minimal visuals with the focus on having the project be gameplay ready first.

The requirements were:
<br>
- Main menu
- Save/Load system
- Cutscene/Dialogue Support
- Top down walkable character
- Collectable currency
- 4 Tower types
- Tower upgrades
- ...and the rest!

You can see the result here:
